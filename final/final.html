  <p>The entertainment industry has potentially met its next match: robotic dolphins. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, also known as <a href="https://peta.org" target="_blank">PETA</a>, has awarded Edge Innovations' Roger Holzberg and Walt Conti with the <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Edge-Innovations.pdf" target="_blank"> Innovator for Animals Award </a> for their design of "Flipper". The partners, both former employees at Walt Disney Imagineering, constructed the 600-pound dolphin that can replace its real-life counterpart in theme parks and aquariums across the globe.</p>

  <p>"This invention will spare dolphins a lifetime of suffering in captivity by replacing them with animatronic replicas that mimic the look, feel, and actions of real dolphins," PETA said in a statement.</p>

  <p>Edge Innovation's design can make a big splash in a struggling industry as marine mammal shows and exhibits have come under significant fire in recent years following the <i>Blackfish</i> documentary in 2013 about the capture and treatment of animals in theme parks.</p>

  <p>"As captive marine mammal shows have fallen from favor; and the catching, transporting and breeding of marine animals has become more restricted, the marine park industry as a viable business has become more challenging," Edge Innovations said. "Yet the audience appetite for this type of entertainment and education has remained constant."

<!--Captivity-->
<p class="chapter" id="captivity">What Animal Captivity Entails</p>

  <p>Dolphins, whales and a number of other marine mammal species have been used for entertainment in nations all over the world for decades. <a href="https://seaworld.com/" target="_blank">SeaWorld,</a> among with hundreds of other smaller parks, use these animals in shows and viewing exhibits as their main attraction.</p>

  <p>The United States ranks third in the world for nations housing dolphins and whales, SeaWorld being a large contributor to this. The company's three parks in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio have 20 orcas and 140 dolphins in captivity.</p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SeaWorld-Dolphin-White-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">study done by PETA,</a> it has been reported that dolphins in the wild swim up to 60 miles per day and dive to depths of nearly 1,500 feet. In the tanks at SeaWorld, the animals are commonly crammed with a number of other dolphins in the tank that has a depth of nearly six feet. </p>

  <blockquote>"There is no record of an Orca doing any harm to any human in the wild."</blockquote>

  <p>Dolphins' counterparts in the worldwide captivity crisis are orcas, or killer whales. These mammals have been the face of SeaWorld Parks since Shamu <a href="https://whalesanctuaryproject.org/first-orcas-captured-sold-marine-parks/" target="_blank">debuted  in 1965.</a> Orcas are largely used for shows in the parks and are also the cause of SeaWorld's decline in the last decade.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/species-guide/orca-killer-whale/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9IX4BRCcARIsAOD2OB1sCbsNd2Jlyynehzb5n73rkwDnTF20cuPVxsZYRv6ir-vIIcuIchUaAs-lEALw_wcB" target="_blank">second-most common death</a> among orcas is captivity, with the first being whaling. When brought into a human environment, these whales become different beings than in the wild, and many die before the average life expectancy is reached.</p>

  <p>On the flip side, killer whales are not dangerous in the wild, but since they have been held in captivity, four people have died at their hands. Three of these deaths were caused by one individual whale, Tilikum, who was the largest male in captivity until his death in 2017.</p>

  <p>"What we learn is that [orcas] are amazingly friendly and understanding and intuitively want to be your companion," Howard Garrett, an orca researcher, said in <i>Blackfish</i>. "And to this day there is no record of an orca doing any harm to any human in the wild."</p>

  <p>The most famous death caused by Tilikum came in 2010, when veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau was performing with the whale when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/24/killer.whale.trainer.death/index.html" target="_blank">she was attacked</a> in front of a full crowd at SeaWorld Orlando. Reports soon after confirmed that she died from drowning and blunt force trauma from Tilikum. The incident sparked controversy with the parks as the safety of the staff was immediately in question. Studies have since shown that whales like Tilikum suffered from a psychosis after living in captivity for an extended period of time, causing violent episodes.</p>

  <p>Activists and animal rights personell have come full force at the captivity issue, especially regarding dolphins and orcas. <i>Blackfish,</i> the groundbreaking 2013 documentary, highlights all the trauma inflicted onto the animals and the deaths like Brancheau's that have been a result of long-term captivity. Since the documentary's release, SeaWorld has seen steady declines in attendance and fiscal earnings.</p>

<p class="chapter" id="outlook">What Captivity Has Done to Parks and What Can Still Be Done</p>

  <p>After millions of people around the world watched the documentary, SeaWorld faced three of its hardest years in history. Visitor numbers fell off in the following years after changes failed to be made regarding animal captivity, until then-CEO Joel Manby annouced that SeaWorld would be <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2019/12/24/its-official-seaworld-orlando-to-debut-new-orca.html" target="_blank">ending orca breeding</a> and begin to phase out shows in the parks in 2016.</p>

  <p>The American parks showed an upswing in revenue at the end of 2018 and as last year's numbers begin to come in, it looks like SeaWorld is on the rise again. Orlando recently annouced a new killer-whale experience, where the trainers will focus on showing audiences the whales' "role in the ocean ecosystem, behaviors the animals exhibit in the wild, the importance of conservation to their habitat, and animal welfare practices at SeaWorld," Chris Dold, chief zoological officer at SeaWorld, said.</p>

  <p>It has not been confirmed yet if parks like SeaWorld will adopt Edge Innovation's "Flipper", but the award-winning prototype looks to be the first step in the new marine mammal entertainment industry. The brand new experience aims to keep SeaWorld afloat, while freeing dolphins and eventually other animals back to the wild.</p>

  <p>"These visionary designers have thrown a lifeline to sensitive dolphins who are exploited in 'swim with dolphins' encounters and archaic marine parks," PETA director of international programmes, Mimi Bekhechi, said.</p>
