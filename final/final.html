  <p>The entertainment industry has potentially met its next match: robotic dolphins. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, also known as <a href="https://peta.org" target="_blank">PETA</a>, has awarded Edge Innovations' Roger Holzberg and Walt Conti with the <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Edge-Innovations.pdf" target="_blank"> Innovator for Animals Award </a> for their design of Flipper. The partners, both former employees at Walt Disney Imagineering, constructed the 600-pound dolphin that can replace its real-life counterpart in theme parks and aquariums across the globe.</p>
  <p>"This invention will spare dolphins a lifetime of suffering in captivity by replacing them with animatronic replicas that mimic the look, feel, and actions of real dolphins," PETA said in a statement.</p>
  <p>Edge Innovation's design can make a big splash in a struggling industry as marine mammal shows and exhibits have come under significant fire in recent years following the <i>Blackfish</i> documentary in 2013 about the capture and treatment of animals in theme parks.</p>
  <p>"As captive marine mammal shows have fallen from favor; and the catching, transporting and breeding of marine animals has become more restricted, the marine park industry as a viable business has become more challenging," Edge Innovations said. "Yet the audience appetite for this type of entertainment and education has remained constant."

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
